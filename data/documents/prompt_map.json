        "prompt": "Is the company clear and transparent about its position on climate change science? This query concerns companies influence over the science of climate change, or the public or policymakers\u2019 understanding of it. It is important because companies has influenced climate change policy through producing doubt around the science\u2019s validity, and through downplaying the implications of climate change and correspondingly what the political response should be. We are looking for companies to talk about climate change. In particular GHG emissions (or land use, forests in a climate context). However, it is important that they are also linking together GHG emissions and climate change. Look out for companies talking about carbon/GHG emissions and climate change separately - like they are not intrinsically linked, as they are potentially expressing their public support for a climate denial. Highest scores are reserved for companies that clearly reference/link rising human activities, GHG emissions and the physical/climatic impact (and/or) the IPCC's reporting."

        "prompt": "Is the organization supporting an IPCC-aligned transition of the economy away from carbon-emitting technologies, including supporting relevant policy and legislative measures to enable this transition?  We are concerned with how companies/trade associations are influencing the broader energy mix, for example in electricity production, is the source coal or wind? We are also concerned with the transitions that need to take place within certain industries. For example, heavy industry (steel, cement, chemicals) also must transition away from fossil fuels. Depending on the industry, this could include technologies and energy sources such as hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, or biomass. As such, this query covers a wide range of policies and potential transition technologies. We also assess engagement on specific policy measures to promote zero/low carbon transition. For example, a car company supporting policies to support electric cars being used in cities."
